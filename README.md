# remember-pat

I am greatly honored to have been awarded a star for this memorial website.  Even more so in view of my age which is 86.  I am a  retired electronics design engineer.  Mostly I designed electronics hardware, although in my sixties I learned to program in 'C' and in National Instruments "C for Virtual Interface".

I created this website in loving memory of my partner Pat.  She was born in Jamaica in 1935 and died in Bromley (suburb of London) in February 2021 aged 86 years.
I miss her so much.  Although we were not married we shared our lives for 40 years.

This website is intended to be viewed with a Smartphone both in Portrait mode (phone vertical) and in Landscape mode (phone horizontal).
The website can also be viewed with a desktop PC where only Landscape mode applies.

I discovered that a Smartphone can display a totally different picture, (NOT merely a modified presentation), between Portrait and Landscape modes.  I have experimented with this but would not recommend it because it can cause confusion.
