# remember-pat

I created this website in loving memory of my partner Pat.  She was born in Jamaica in 1935 and died in Bromley (suburb of London) in February 2021 aged 86 years.
I miss her so much.  Although we were not married we shared our lives for 40 years.

This website is intended to be viewed with a Smartphone both in Portrait mode (phone vertical) and in Landscape mode (phone horizontal).
The website can also be viewed with a desktop PC where only Landscape mode applies.

I discovered that a Smartphone can display a totally different picture between Portrait and Landscape modes.  Although I have experimented with this I would not
recommend it because it can cause confusion.
